TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week we did a quiz. It was sort of hard towards the end as I found the json parts hard and the filler parts. I will probably need to go over these bits in the future and practice the exercises to get better at python.
There were some exercises that were a little bit challenging at first but I was overthinking it and then I realised the solution was much more simple than I thought.
