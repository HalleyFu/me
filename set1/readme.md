TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
need to be careful with characters
ask peers for help
today I over looked reading the information that I was getting back from tests which would help pass in the end
kind of unclear about why you use certain characters/words in a particular situation 
also learn on how to type push and pull commands on YouTube rather than using the interface which should be handy
