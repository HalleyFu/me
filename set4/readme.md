TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
For exercise 1, it was sort of hard to understand what JSON was but after some research on the internet it was sort of easier. Now I know that I'm importing data and sorting through the data and returning the data I want into a dictionary. The nesting can get kind of confusing. I also forgot to call the functions in the end which is why my test was not running but I realised the mistake.
